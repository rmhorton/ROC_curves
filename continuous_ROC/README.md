# Continuous ROC Explorer

The Continuous ROC Explorer is an interactive, browser-based teaching app for visualizing and understanding Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis using analytic probability distributions. Unlike sample-based ROC tools, it computes curves analytically from user-defined continuous distributions, allowing precise exploration of sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and AUC. Teachers can fully customize the appâ€™s configuration, add new distributions, and save or share scenarios as JSON files. The app is ideal for classroom demonstrations, self-guided student exercises, and advanced courses in biostatistics, data science, or machine learning.

For full documentation, customization instructions, and the Codex implementation roadmap, see the User & Teacher Guide.
